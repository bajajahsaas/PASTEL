Common:
Unzip post-processed data from the link shared under DEPENDENCIES under this directory as home. 
On unzipping, a directory named data/ with the post-processed train-test splits will be present.
There are many files, you may ignore most of them other than the ones we discuss here for now.

{splitName}.STYLED.{src/tgt} denotes the respective src/tgt file for the corresponding split name
As mentioned in the paper, the src sentences are the original VIST story captions, while tgt are our annotated sentences with specific target style
As dicussed in DEPENDENCIES, The target style appears as tokens prepended to each src sentence line.

ApproachName: EmbDistRetrieve
1. Under glove/, download wiki.simple.vec from the link supplied in DEPENDENCIES

2. cd to glove/ and run python constructEmbeddingDump.py. This will use glove/wiki.simple.vec to create embeddingDict.p, an intermediate file which EmbDistRetrieve uses.

3. Run sh runEmbDistRetrieve.sh. 
   
   1. This first runs findDeleteLexicon.py and outputs the generated output file for the test set, data/test.STYLED.src.delete
   2. It then runs computeNLGEvalMetrics.py to compute the various metrics comparing outputs and the file of references, i.e data/test.STYLED.tgt
