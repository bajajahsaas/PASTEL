# PASTEL
Data and code for ["(Male, Bachelor) and (Female, Ph.D) have different connotations : Parallelly Annotated Stylistic Language Dataset with Multiple Personas"](https://arxiv.org/) by Dongyeop Kang, Varun Gangal, and Eduard Hovy, EMNLP 2019

## The PASTEL dataset
PASTEL is a dataset of XXX.
The dataset consists of over XXX.

We structured the dataset into XXX. Each is further split into the train/dev/test splits (same splits used in the paper). Due to licensing constraints, we provide instructions and scripts for downloading the VIST dataset for raw reference sentences and images.

## Setup Configuration
Run `./setup.sh` at the root of this repository to install dependencies and download the VIST dataset.

## Models
In order to experiment with (and hopefully improve) our models for controlled style classification (i.e., given a text, predict a gender of it) and parallel style transfer.
